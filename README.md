# FlappyShooter
This game was developed in C using the "raylib" library. The game involves moving one flappy (WASD) and pressing the other flappy (SPACE).
In each folder for each version you will find the executable file for Windows (.exe), the source code called "main.c" and the "img" folder with the various images.
To run the .exe file you need to have the "img" folder in the same folder as the file.
